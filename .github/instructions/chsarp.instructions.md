# C# Development Guidelines

## Official Documentation References

**ALWAYS** reference the latest official documentation when working with C# and .NET:

- **.NET Documentation**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/
- **.NET Fundamentals**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/
- **ASP.NET Core**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-10.0
- **Blazor**: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor
- **Azure**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=popular
- **Azure China**: https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/

## Syncfusion Components Integration

This application **ALWAYS** uses Syncfusion Blazor components. When writing C# code:

- **Syncfusion Documentation**: https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/introduction
- **Syncfusion API Reference**: https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.html
- Ensure compatibility with Syncfusion.Blazor latest version and .NET latest version
- Use strongly-typed Syncfusion component properties and events
- Implement data models that work efficiently with Syncfusion Grid's data binding
- Handle Syncfusion component events (OnChange, OnActionComplete, etc.) properly
- Leverage Syncfusion's server-side data operations (filtering, sorting, paging) for performance

## C# Version and Language Features

- Always use the latest C# version and features:
  - Primary constructors for classes and structs
  - Collection expressions: `[]`, `[.. items]`
  - Inline arrays and improved pattern matching
  - Required members and init-only properties
  - File-scoped namespaces
  - Global and implicit usings
  - Record types and record structs
  - Raw string literals for multi-line text
  - Generic attributes
  - Lambda improvements and natural delegate types
  - List patterns and enhanced pattern matching
  - Static abstract members in interfaces
- Write clear and concise comments for each public method and complex logic
- Use C# XML documentation comments (`///`) for all public APIs

## General Instructions

- Make only high-confidence suggestions when reviewing code changes
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments explaining why certain design decisions were made
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling with specific exception types
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns where appropriate
- Implement proper logging using ILogger<T> dependency injection
- Use async/await consistently for I/O-bound operations
- Implement cancellation tokens for long-running async operations
- Write code that is testable and follows dependency injection patterns

## Build and Error Resolution

**CRITICAL**: Always build the project and fix all errors after making changes:

- After creating or modifying any C# files, **ALWAYS** build the project and solution to verify compilation
- Check for and resolve ALL compilation errors, warnings, and code analysis issues
- Use the editor's error diagnostics to identify and fix issues
- Never leave code in a non-compiling state
- If errors occur:
  - Read the error messages carefully and understand the root cause
  - Fix errors systematically, starting with the first error (subsequent errors may be cascading)
  - Re-build after each fix to verify the issue is resolved
  - Check for missing using statements, incorrect namespaces, or typos
  - Verify NuGet package references and versions are correct
- Test the changes functionally after successful compilation
- Run `dotnet restore` if package-related errors occur
- Clear bin/obj folders if strange build errors persist: `dotnet clean`

## Naming Conventions

- Follow PascalCase for component names, method names, and public members
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., IUserService)

## Formatting

- Apply code-formatting style defined in `.editorconfig`
- Prefer file-scoped namespace declarations (namespace MyApp;)
- Use single-line using directives and global usings where appropriate
- Insert a newline before the opening curly brace of any code block
- Ensure that the final return statement of a method is on its own line
- Use pattern matching and switch expressions wherever possible
- Use `nameof` instead of string literals when referring to member names
- Ensure that XML doc comments (`///`) are created for any public APIs
- When applicable, include `<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`, `<exception>`, `<example>`, and `<code>` documentation
- Use expression-bodied members for simple properties and methods
- Group using directives: System namespaces first, then third-party, then project namespaces
- Order class members: constants, fields, constructors, properties, methods, events
- Use `var` for local variables when the type is obvious

## Project Setup and Structure

- Guide users through creating new .NET projects with appropriate templates
- Explain the purpose of each generated file and folder to build understanding
- Demonstrate how to organize code using feature folders or domain-driven design principles

- Separate shared code into reusable class libraries

## Nullable Reference Types

- **IMPORTANT**: This project has Nullable disabled (`<Nullable>disable</Nullable>`)
- Be aware that null reference warnings are not enforced
- Still implement defensive null checks at entry points and public APIs
- Always use `is null` or `is not null` instead of `== null` or `!= null`
- Consider enabling nullable reference types in new projects for better null safety
- Use null-forgiving operator `!` sparingly and only when absolutely certain
- Add `#nullable enable` directive in individual files when migrating to nullable reference types

## Data Access Patterns

- Explain different options for data access based on the project (SQL Server, Azure SQL, Firebase, Blob Storage)
- This project uses:
  - SQL Server with Dapper (SqlDataAccess.cs)
  - Azure Blob Storage (BlobDataAccess.cs)
  - Firebase Admin SDK for push notifications
- Demonstrate repository pattern implementation and when it's beneficial
- Show how to implement database migrations using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) projects

## Project-Specific Guidelines

- **Multi-Project Solution**: Vectus has multiple projects (MAUI, Web, Shared, Library, API)
- **Shared Library**: Business logic is in `VectusLibrary` - always check here before adding new data access code
- **Database**: SQL Server database project in `DBVectus` with stored procedures and views
- **Excel Import**: Utility project `ExcelImport` for data import operations
- **Code Reuse**: Maximize code sharing between Web and MAUI projects through `Vectus.Shared`
- **Dependency Injection**: Register services appropriately for each project type
- **Configuration**: Use appsettings.json for Web, MauiProgram.cs for MAUI
- **Data Models**: Keep models in `VectusLibrary/Models` for consistency
- **Export Logic**: Implement export functionality in `VectusLibrary/Exports`
- **Styling Consistency**: Reuse global styles from `Vectus.Shared/wwwroot/app.css` when available instead of duplicating local page styles
- **CSS Cleanup**: Remove unused CSS and stale style rules introduced by UI changes in the same update

## Security Best Practices

- Use HTTPS everywhere and enforce it in production
- Implement proper CORS policies for API access
- Use secure headers middleware
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting for APIs
- Use secure cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags
- Follow principle of least privilege for service accounts and database access
- Keep all NuGet packages and dependencies up to date
- Regular security scanning with tools like OWASP Dependency-Check
